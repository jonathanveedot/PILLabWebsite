PILLab Website v2: Adminstrative Portal

Overview

The PILLab is seeking to transform their current website (www.pillab.tech) into a communication and branding platform for their organization. This essentially requires the development an administrative dashboard for managing content, the implementation of session management strategies, and the production of scripts used to dynamically present content. Students who work on this project will gain experience in full-stack (LAMP) development, with an emphasis in database design and interface design under the guidance of domain and technical experts. This product will go live into service upon completion of the project, and will make an excellent professional achievement in any student’s portfolio.

Downloads:

I recommend downloading PhpStorm IDE:

The web portal will actually run on a LAMP stack, but downloading the following in order to run your web project locally. 
If you have Windows, it's a WAMP stack:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/
If you have macOS, it's a MAMP stack:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mamp/

For those working on the database:
